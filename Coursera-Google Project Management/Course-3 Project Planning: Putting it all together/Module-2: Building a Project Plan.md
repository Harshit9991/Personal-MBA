# Components of a Project Plan
A project plan can be useful for any project, big or small, since it helps you document the scope, tasks, milestones, and overall activities of the project.

At the center of the project plan is the project schedule. The project schedule can help you estimate the amount of time it'll take to complete the project, and it can provide the team with a way to track the project's progress against your goals. What goes into a project plan may vary from company to company, but most plans contain these five basic elements:
1) **Tasks**: Activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time. Tasks are assigned to different members according to their roles and skills.
2) **Milestones**: Important points within the schedule that indicate progress. They usually signify the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.
3) **People**: A project plan will also include the people working on your team and their roles. It's important that each team member understands their role and the tasks they're responsible for completing. Ensuring that everyone is clear on their assigned tasks frees you up to focus on managing the project and creates a sense of personal responsibility for members of the team. 
4) **Documentation**:  project plan is a good place to link to relevant documentation. This includes documents like your RACI chart, which helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals on your team. You can also link to your charter, which clearly defines the project and outlines the details needed to reach your goals. Relevant documentation can also include documents like your budget and risk management plan.
5) **Time**: The estimated time includes dates on which tasks should be started and completed and the dates when you hope to reach various milestones. It also includes the start and end dates of the project, which are important in determining which resources you'll need and when you'll need them.

Other than the 5 points above, one can also include the following components into project plan:
1) Scope & Goals
2) Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)
3)Budget
4) Management Plans

# Making Realistic Time Estimates
One of the key responsibilities of a project manager is identifying and helping assign those tasks, and then estimating how long they'll take to complete. These estimates come together to determine the overall project schedule.
Estimations are carried out via the help of the team.

## Time estimation is a prediction of the total amount of time required to complete a task. Effort estimation is a prediction of the amount and difficulty of active work required to complete a task. ##

Here's an example. The effort estimation for painting a wall might be 30 minutes, but time estimation might be 24 hours. That's because in addition to the 30 minutes of active painting time, there are also 23 and a half hours of inactive drying time. It's important to understand the difference between time estimation and effort estimation, because it can help you be more efficient with your available resources.
