# Benefits of Project Planning
Project Planning: The phase where the Project Manager and related team members will discuss the process and workflows needed to make the project a success.
Planning helps in: 
1) Mapping out the full project and helps understand the work needed to achieve goals.
2) Aligning efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors and vendors.
3) Giving time to identify and prepare for risks that could impact your project. Those might include things like a delay in the timeline, the departure of a critical team member, or a change in project direction from a primary stakeholder.
4) Giving the chance to brainstorm ways to mitigate or address those risks. 

The relatively less obvious benefits are: 
1) Getting buy-in from key members of the team.
2) Showcasing to stakeholders that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan.
3) Teamwork.
4) Creating a shared understanding among all parties involved in the project. 

# Launching the Planning Phase
Even though a planning phase might differ from project to project, the general 3 big things are worked out in this stage: Schedule, Budget, and Risk Management Plan.
Schedule: Includes a number of key dates like requesting proposals from vendors(if any), project kickoff date, execution milestones, target date of launch, etc.
Budget: Accounts for the total cost to complete the project. The total cost needs to be broken down to determine how much has to be spent on different elements of the project. This can include breaking down cost by virtue of sub-points like: the cost of designing a landing page, cost of hiring vendors, etc.
Risk Management: searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate these risks. Risk is inevitable in every project, but with proper risk management techniques and frameworks, the impact of risks can be mitigated.

# Facilitating a Project Kick-off Meeting

Project Kick-off meeting signals a formal start to Project Planning Phase.
**A project kickoff meeting is the first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roles within the team.**
The team members involved in a Project members would be all the members identified in the RACI chart created during the Initiation phase. During the kickoff meeting, team members will learn more about how they'll contribute to the project and how they'll gain a deeper understanding of how the team will work together to reach the project's goals.
Naturally, the Stakeholders and the Project Sponsor can also be invited to the Kick-off meeting so that they have a chance to understand the high-level plan for the project, can share their perspective, and it can be ensured that everyone is on the same wavelength.

## Kick-off meeting Agenda
1) Introductions: ~10 mins for everyone to introduce themselves & their roles.
2) Overview & Background of the Project: ~5 mins by Project Manager(About how the project came to be? Whay the project matters? & setting a shared vision).
3) Goals and Scope: ~5 mins overview of in-scope, out-of-scope, Target launch date, & milestones that the team needs to be made aware of.
4) Roles: ~5 mins on What work everyone is responsible for throughout the duration of the project.
5) Collaboration: ~10 mins Shared project tools & documents that will serve as a communal source of informaiton for the team, Communication expectations(be it daily updates? weekly meetings? chat rooms?)
6) What Comes next?: ~10 mins setting expectations on what's coming up & action items.
7) Questions from the group: ~15 mins

Document these and send it to meeting attendees generally a day or two before the kick-off meeting. The project manager leads the majority of the meeting, and it can be difficult to take notes, either ask a friend to do it, or record the entire meeting with everyone's consent. Send a follow-up email to the group with the meeting notes, summarizing key points and outcomes from the meeting, and any action items to the attendees, invtie attendees to reach out in case of questions as well.

# Understanding Taaks & Milestones & The importance of setting Milesotnes

**A project milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 
A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. The work of a project is broken down into many different tasks. In order to reach a milestone, the team must complete multiple tasks.**
Setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require. The act of setting milestones forces you to break your project down into more manageable chunks. 
If deliverables are broken down into milestones and those milestones into tasks, you will have a better sense of the true amount of work that needs to be done. This will help you better manage the project workload.
Another reason milestones are so great is that they can help keep your project on track. When you set a milestone, you assign clear deadlines for when certain project deliverables need to be completed. Then, as you work through the execution phase, you can look back at these deadlines to make sure that the project is progressing at the right pace.
A third reason you'll want to set milestones is that they help you uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals. For example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you'd anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number of tasks.
there's one more reason milestones are so important. Actually reaching milestones can seriously motivate your team and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders. With big projects that go on for months, you'll want to keep the team's motivation high. A milestone signifies the completion of an important chunk of work and provides a moment of celebration for the team, even if there's more work ahead. Milestones also serve as a great check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders. 
 it's important to reach milestones in sequential order, but it's just as important that you reach them on time. If the team misses the mark to complete a deliverable tied to a specific milestone, it could set back your project schedule, meaning your team might need to work overtime or add additional resources to catch up.

# How to set milestones

1) Evaluate your project as a whole (Might need to go back to project charter and look at the Project goal)
2) Make a list of what the team needs to do to achieve that goal. The big items in this list are the milestones & the small items are tasks.
3) Assign each milestone a deadline (Connect wih teammates to discuss on realistic estimates. Assign milestone deadline based on that estimate. Also consider stakeholders on their expectation on project deliverables.)

# Creating a Work Breakdown Structure
 A work breakdown structure, often abbreviated to WBS, is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. This is a helpful tool because it helps break down the sometimes intimidating challenges of a project into more manageable chunks.

Work breakdown structure shown here breaks a project goal into 3 milestones, and each milestone into subsequent tasks.

## Steps to creating a WBS

1) Start with High-level overarching projust picture. Brainstorm with team to list major deliverables and milestones.
2) Identify tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones
3) Examine those tasks and break them down into further subtasks
